The module can do it automatically going on "configuration" page and clicking the activate buttons for CMS or CATEGORY page, it works well for default themes, just remember that not every theme is the same so it is possible that the automatic method doesn't work for you specific theme. The module prefer doing nothing if it is unable to determine where to place the hook avoiding breaking your shop. In this case follow the instruction for manual activation.	Do this module works on mobile phones?-	Yes, at least on any modern smartphone able to navigate internet pages. Sometimes it works better on mobile phone than in Internet Explorer :)Is this module responsive?-	Yes, but it needs your theme to be responsive too. It will not make your theme responsive.What browser are supported?-	Any modern browser IE8, IE9, IE10, IE11, Opera, Chrome, Firefox, Safary, the lastest versions of all those browser are supported. Just the 3D animation could not work on some older browser due to the lack of 3D support. It will try to detect those browsers and switch to "Fade" animation if 3D is not supported.May I customize my galleries?-	Yes, you can change different things, choose how the gallery is animated, customize timing, buttons and title placement and the gallery size.	I have some text on my images and my shop is multilingual, can I have a different image for every language?-	Yes, when you upload your images uncheck "Same image for all languages" and upload a different image for every active language.	I don't need the description or the url link.-	Just leave it blank.	Should the url link be absolute or relative?-	You choose, anyway if you are linking to a page of your own shop I advise you tu use relative link so if you want an image to link to a specific category of your shop don't use "http://www.example.com/en/cat/37/dresses" but just "/cat/37/dresses", excluding the first part and the language code you will get the corret url for every language since prestashop remember the language of the current user and automatically will bring him to the correct page.	How do I create a new Gallery?-	Go to "Preferences" -> "Sliders EveryWhere" in your backoffice, in "Slides Setup" type the New Slider Name and click "Add New Slider".	I cannot find the sliders setup page where it is? -	Go to "Preferences" -> "Sliders EveryWhere" in your backoffice.	Why this module have it's own menu tab?-	This will allow your emplyee (if you want) to easily find it and manage it, the module have some basic permission configuration too.	Why my gallery stop the auto advance when I clic on a control?-	This is the default behaviour if you prefer the slider to keep moving after clicking on controls enable "Auto Restart";	Where can I place my sliders?-	Anywhere?! By default you can place your gallery in any default Prestashop hook, like Homepage, Top, Left and Right Sidebar, Left and Right Product Sidebar Footer and Product Footer.-	If you activate the "Category functionality" you can even replace the category image with a slider.-	If you activate the "CMS functionality" you can place a gallery on top of your CMS pages.-	You can use the "Custom hook" to place the slider in any other part of your shop.-	For CMS pages you can use shorcodes to place a slider/gallery directly in your cms page text editor (for this to work you don't need the "CMS functionality")	How to show an image, or gallery in my product category page?-	Go to "Preferences" -> "Sliders EveryWhere" in your backoffice. Locate the name of the slider you want to place in a specific Category and click on the category text area. A pupup will appear allowing you to choose what category.	How to show an image, or gallery in a CMS page?-	Go to "Preferences" -> "CMS" in your backoffice and adit the CMS page where you want the slider to appear. You should see a new field allowing you to select a gallery. Or you can copy/paste your slider shortcode directly in the description!	What is a "shortcode"?-	A "shortcode" is a small piece of code (wordpress uses a lot) that you can enter in a textarea and will be replaced with a gallery or something else.	What is a "Hook"?-	Prestashop call HOOKS specific "places" or "parts" of the template where modules can be "attached" to display things, common hooks are Header, Homepage, Sidebars etc.Why to write a FAQ?-	Because many of those questions are already been answered in the forums, but people is lazy, so now I can say: "did you read the FAQ"?	Is this module really free?-	No, not really, is a joke! It costs a lot of hours developing it.	Why is it free?-	Despite many hours spent developing it I believe that free modules will make Prestashop more used by everyone, and if it gets more attention more developers will work on it making it better and better. And I believe that sharing knowledge is how mankind can really evolve.
